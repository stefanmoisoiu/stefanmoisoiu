### 🕹️ What I'm working on

Currently, I am developing a **Multiplayer Casual Shooter** in Unity, featuring an extensive upgrade system that fundamentally shapes the way you play.
My current focus is on building a robust foundation that feels responsive even under harsh network conditions (4G/Wifi).

**Key Technical Implementations:**
* **Physics:** Custom Deterministic Physics solution using CharacterBody.
* **Multiplayer:** Building a secure and responsive architecture using Unity Netcode for GameObjects.
* **Gameplay:** Creating a fun and varied game loop designed for high replayability.
* **Design:** Crafting coherent visuals that tell a story and keep the player captivated.
